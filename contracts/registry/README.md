# curve-contract/contracts/registry

A streamlined version of the Curve [pool registry](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-pool-registry) is available on Polygon. The address provider is deployed to the same address as on Ethereum:

* [`0x0000000022D53366457F9d5E68Ec105046FC4383`](https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/address/0x0000000022D53366457F9d5E68Ec105046FC4383)

Contracts that are unchanged between Ethereum and Polygon are not included within this repo. Contracts included here have been modified to better fit the requirements of Curve on Polygon. The public APIs are consistent between ETH and Polygon.
